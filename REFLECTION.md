### What was the most helpful aspect of this codeâ€™s structure?
Each part of the program was broken into its own function, which made it easier to follow and understand.  I was able test and modify the log without needing to change anything.  

### What part was confusing or took longer to understand?
The part that took me the longest was figuring out how mostReadBook() counted. It was hard to see what the loop was doing with the book names and numbers, but became apparent once I read through it a few times.
